### 🧠 What is Dev.env-ResourceX?

Dev.env-ResourceX is not just a modular development environment—it's also a **Resource Exchange System**. This means you can:

* Seamlessly share, manage, and access development resources like scripts, models, assets, and configuration files.
* Use the platform to **upload, fetch, or update resources** from various development domains (e.g., web, ML, graphics).
* Enable **cross-functional collaboration** between frontend, backend, and data teams through a unified structure.

### 🔧 How to Use the Resource Exchange:

1. **Upload a Resource:** Navigate to the desired module (e.g., `backend/`, `models/`, etc.) and add the resource.
2. **Tag it:** Use metadata files to categorize and describe the resource.
3. **Sync:** Pull updated resources or push your own using provided CLI or API tools.
4. **Collaborate:** Team members can fetch the latest version of assets via the resource sync interface.
